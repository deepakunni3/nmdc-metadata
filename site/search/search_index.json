It may be environmental (encompassing many organisms) or isolate or tissue. An environmental sample containing genetic material from multiple individuals is commonly referred to as a biosample. BiosampleProcessing - A process that takes one or more biosamples as inputs and generates one or as outputs. Examples of outputs include samples cultivated from another sample or data objects created by instruments runs.

CURIEs - prefixed IDs Following McMurry et al we adopt the use of prefixed identifiers The syntax is: Prefix:LocalId Examples: GO:0008152 BIOSAMPLE:SAMEA2397676 DOI:10.1038/nbt1156 These prefixed identifiers are also known as CURIEs (Compact URIs). There is a W3C specification for these All prefixes should be registered with a standard identifier prefix system. These include: http://n2t.net http://identifiers.org http://obofoundry.org Examples INSDC BioSamples Registry entry: https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/biosample Example ID/CURIE: BIOSAMPLE:SAMEA2397676 Resolving via identifiers.org: https://identifiers.org/BIOSAMPLE:SAMEA2397676 Resolving via nt2.net: http://n2t.net/BIOSAMPLE:SAMEA2397676 GOLD identifiers https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/gold Example ID: GOLD:Gp0119849 Resolving via identifiers.org: https://identifiers.org/GOLD:Gp0119849 identifiers for ontology terms and function descriptors Most of the ontologies we use are in OBO. All OBO IDs are prefixed using the ontology ID space. The list of ID spaces can be found on http://obofoundry.org For example the ID/CURIE ENVO:00002007 represents the class sediment and is expanded to a URI of http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007 KEGG KEGG is actually a set of databases, each with its own prefix, usually of form KEGG.$database , e.g. KEGG.ORTHOLOGY (aka KO), e.g. KEGG.ORTHOLOGY:K00001 KEGG.COMPOUND , e.g. KEGG.COMPOUND:C12345 Recommended IDs for use within NMDC The NMDC schema is annotated with the set of IDs that are allowed to act as primary keys for instances of each class. For example the class OrthologyGroup has a description of the IDs allowed on the class web page, the first listed is KEGG.ORTHOLOGY The underlying yaml looks like this: orthology group: is_a: functional annotation term description: >- A set of genes or gene products in which all members are orthologous id_prefixes: - KEGG.ORTHOLOGY ## KO number - EGGNOG - PFAM - TIGRFAM - SUPFAM - PANTHER.FAMILY exact_mappings: - biolink:GeneFamily The full URLs for each is in the jsonld context file IDs minted for use within NMDC Note that NMDC schema mandates IDs for most objects. These always have the field name id Reuse vs minting new IDs We try to reuse IDs as far as possible. For example, for any sample already in GOLD, we use the GOLD sample identifier, e.g. GOLD:Gb..... IDs generated during workflows This section is in progress. See https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-metadata/issues/195 All instances of OmicsProcessing have IDs. The policy for ID depends on the provider.
